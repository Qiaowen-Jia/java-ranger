To record where I stopped before moving on to ContractDR. I was trying to use the Z3 incremental bit vector solver instead of the z3 incremental solver. I was validating both results on TestCasePerf.
I finished checking doubleBranchCov(1,1), and I was looking into doubleBranchCov(1,1). I could see possible unnecessary test case generated by the Z3 incremental bit vector mode.
